# CRUD Simple App V2

This mini project is the second version of the same app with that name, where the difference is that now instead of saving the tasks in local memory, this app is able to save the data directly in the database called **"Firestore"**.

This mini project makes use of **React JS**, uses the **CRUD** methodology through the different hooks offered by React, and is also part of the exercises done in my React JS specialization course taught in [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-react-js/).
